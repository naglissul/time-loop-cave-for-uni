# time-loop-cave
## Software engeneering Java course project
Used abstract classes (GameState, GameObject) and interfaces (Movable - I wish this is enough for the task).  
Also used a Collection (LinkedList) in Level1 and some enhanced for loops. 

Use arrows to move the player
Press space to shoot
