# time-loop-cave

## Software engeneering Java course project

Used abstract classes (GameState, GameObject) and interfaces (Movable - I wish this is enough for the task).  
Also used a Collection (LinkedList) in Level1 and some enhanced for loops.

FOR THE THIRD TASK:
Lambda expressions are used in directing the bullet and iterating through game objects.
Exceptions are used in Level1 map reading from file.

Use arrows to move the player
Press space to shoot
